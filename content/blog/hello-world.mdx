# Hello World

Welcome to my personal site! This is where I'll be sharing **GPU-rich stories**, computational stances, and various technical explorations.

## What to Expect

This site serves as a digital archive for:

- **Blog posts**: Technical insights and tutorials
- **Stories**: GPU-rich narratives about computational experiences
- **Stances**: My opinions on technology and computing trends
- **Papers**: Research work and academic contributions

## Why GPUs?

Graphics Processing Units have revolutionized not just gaming, but scientific computing, machine learning, and creative applications. The parallel nature of GPU computing opens up fascinating possibilities for:

```python
import torch

# Simple GPU acceleration example
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    print(f"Using GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name()}")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    print("Using CPU")

# Create tensors on GPU
x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device)
y = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device)

# Parallel matrix multiplication
result = torch.mm(x, y)
```

## The Journey Ahead

This site will document my explorations in:

- High-performance computing
- GPU programming with CUDA and OpenCL
- Machine learning infrastructure
- Creative coding with shaders
- Systems programming

Stay tuned for more content!
